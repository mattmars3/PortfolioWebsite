                <h2>First Steps</h2>
                <p>
                    I started coding on January 23, 2020.
                    I thought that coding was interesting and I started learning
                    javascript with codecademy. I didn't stick with it very long
                    because I struggled to apply it. However, when given
                    an assignment to create a game in Scratch, I reconsidered
                    programming. I thought that if I was making a game, I might
                    as well do it in a real programming language to challenge myself
                    and learn some coding. I started learning some basic python and
                    created a basic game in python and PyGame. Looking back,
                    I realize how awful the code was, but the game worked and the
                    assignment successfully sparked my interest in programming.

                <p>
                    Soon after, I started using java by taking a course. I created
                    some small projects but didn't really stick with the language
                    or create anything meaningful. I would continue to hop around
                    and half-learn languages for the next year. Then, I started to
                    really develop an understanding converting my ideas into code.
                    I started writing decent code and created some small projects.
                    Most were scripts that would spam a KaHoot lobby or something
                    simple and funny. After about two years of programming, I really
                    started getting better. I developed another python game that was
                    much more complicated. This was my first well-developed project.
                    I was incredibly proud for really dedicating my time and creating
                    something substantial rather than just a small script.

                <h2>Learning in School</h2>
                <p>
                    Going into my junior year of highschool, I opted to take Intro to
                    Programming and AP Computer Science. I was overjoyed to be able to
                    study programming in an academic setting. I successfully applied
                    my previous java skills in AP Computer Science which helped me excel 
                    in the class.

                <h2>Current Progress</h2>
                <p>
                    Recently I have started learning web development.
                    My next great project was an ACT practice tracking tool. It essentially
                    records scores, averages, and other data about a specific practice test.
                    My most advanced project to date has been this portfolio website.
                    I can showcase projects from all of my hobbies while learning
                    about web development by coding the website. I hope to continue
                    developing this site and incorporating my projects into the site.
